# Battle Simulator
Game made during my first CS class which uses "the_maze"'s search algorithm to find enemy units, attack them and win the game.

# How to set it up:
1º Download the python file<br />
2º Create a text file with the name "config.txt" with the instructions provided<br />
3º Run the game<br />

# How to set up the config.txt file:
Create tuples with the following info (an example was provided on the repository):<br />
1º map size (x, y)<br />
2º name, hp and force of team 1 ("name", hp, force)<br />
3º name, hp and force of team 2 ("name", hp, force)<br />
4º position of internal walls ((x, y), (x, y))<br />
5º position of team 1's units ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y))<br />
6º position of team 2's units ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y))<br />
