# battle_simulator
Game made during my first CS class which uses "the_maze"'s search algorithm to find enemy units, attack them and win the game.

# How to set it up:
1º Download the python file
2º Create a text file with the name "config.txt" with the instructions provided
3º Run the game

# How to set up the config.txt file:
Create tuples with the following info (an example was provided on the repository):
1º map size (x, y)
2º name, hp and force of team 1 ("name", hp, force)
3º name, hp and force of team 2 ("name", hp, force)
4º position of internal walls ((x, y), (x, y))
5º position of team 1's units ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y))
6º position of team 2's units ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y))
